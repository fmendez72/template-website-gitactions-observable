# About This Project

This site demonstrates a simple **Quarto + Observable** integration.

- The site is built entirely with Quarto.
- The data table is rendered client-side via Observable.
- Everything is hosted statically on **GitHub Pages**.

This structure is ideal for collaborative academic or research websites where one person manages the layout, and collaborators can edit text content directly through GitHub's web interface.
